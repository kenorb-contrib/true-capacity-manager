True Capacity is an open-source flashdrive/memorycard capacity tester (Bash script) for GNU/Linux, licensed under release 1.0 of the Comprehensible Open License.

Features:
- 2 stages of authentication. The first authentication reports approximately how much data was written to the device. The second authentication reports approximately how much data is on the device.

True Capacity 1.0 Stable has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop AMD64, but should work on any GNU/Linux distro provided Bash is used as the shell, and the following dependencies are installed (as well as accessible without specifying an executable path!): sed, bc, and coreutils (wc,rm,tail,dd). To install True Capacity, extract the files to a folder in a location of your choice (eg: ~/true-capacity), and install the dependencies. To launch use "bash ~/true-capacity/true-capacity-manager" (substitute "~/true-capacity" for the location you saved True Capacity). In order to test a device, your device MUST be setup with, ideally an MBRPT (Master Boot Record Partition Table), 1 full length partition, ideally an EXT2 filesystem, and contain NO data. Deviation from this may yeild results of less accuracy.
